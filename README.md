## FUNCTIONS OF JAVASCRIPT USED IN THE WEBPAGE:

#### There are 8 javascript functions used on the webpage :
````
Serial Number)
  a) Use

  b) Function Explaination	
````
		1)	
			a) This function is used to add a class in "overlay" when full webpage is loaded .

			b) The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting 
			existing event handlers,syntax element.addEventListener(event, function) . I had used 
			load event in addEventListener() which call the function when the webpage is completely loaded . 
			
				//window.addEventListener("load",function(){

			"loader" is a constant which has all elements of class name "overlay" .	

	    			//const loader=document.querySelector(".overlay");
	    	
	    	HTMLElementObject.className += class adds the "class" to the class name of the HTMLElementObject . we
		know loader has element with class name "overlay" . After the below given line is executed class name
		of loader is changed to "overlay hidden" . "hidden" class hides the loader after the webpage is loaded .
	    	
	    			//loader.className+=" hidden";
				//});


       	2)
       		a) This function is used to make operations on datepicker used in survey form and decide what will be 
		the value of the datepicker .
			
			b)A date-picker of jQuery UI is used to provide a calendar to the user to select the date from a
			Calendar. This date picker usually connected to a text-box so user selection of date from the 
			calendar can be transferred to the textbox.
			
			Element is seached with name "datefilter" and of input category . In this autoupdate input is
			placed false means value is not autoupdated .
		        //$(function() {
		            //$('input[name="datefilter"]').daterangepicker({
		            //autoUpdateInput: false,
		            //locale: {
		               //cancelLabel: 'Clear'
		            //}
		        //});

		    	When we click on apply in "datefilter" this function change the value of "datefilter" with
			"startDate - endDate" in MM/DD/YYYY format .   
		        //$('input[name="datefilter"]').on('apply.daterangepicker', function(ev, picker) {
		               //$(this).val("    "+picker.startDate.format('MM/DD/YYYY') + ' - ' + 
			       //picker.endDate.format('MM/DD/YYYY'));
		        //});

		    When we click on cancel in "datefilter" this function change the value of "datefilter" with "       
		    Add Dates Here By Clicking On It" .    	
		        //$('input[name="datefilter"]').on('cancel.daterangepicker', function(ev, picker) {
		               //$(this).val('       Add Dates Here By Clicking On It');
		            //});
		        //});
         

        3) 	
        	a) This function is used to position the fixed header after 600 px and add some class to it .
			
		b) The "onscroll" event occurs when an element's scrollbar is being scrolled. When someone scroll, it
		calls "myFunction" function.
		    	
		    	//window.onscroll = function() {myFunction()};

		    The getElementById() method returns the element that has the ID attribute with the specified value
		    ,whose syntax is document.getElementById(elementID). "header" is a variable which has the element
		    whose id is "myHeader" .
		    	
		    	//var header = document.getElementById("myHeader");

		    "myFunction" is a function which is being called by onscroll event as mentioned above.	

		    	//function myFunction() {
			
		    "pageYOffset" properties returns the pixels the current document has been scrolled from the upper
		    left corner of the window, vertically , whose syntax is window.pageYOffset . If "pageYOffset" is
		    greater then 600 the it will move inside the "if  loop" .	
			    	//if (window.pageYOffset > 600) {

			The classList property returns the class name(s) of an element, as a DOMTokenList object.This
			property is useful to add, remove and toggle CSS classes on an element. It will add "sticky"
			class to the class list of header .   	
			           //header.classList.add("sticky");

			The css() method sets or returns one or more style properties for the selected elements.
			Element with id "myHeader" is selected and in css of it sets "display" with "block" .           
			           //$("#myHeader").css("display","block");

			If "pageYOffset" is not greater then 600 the it will move inside the "else  loop" .           
			        //}else {

			It will remove "sticky" class to the class list of header .        
			           //header.classList.remove("sticky");

			Element with id "myHeader" is selected and in css of it sets "display" with "none" .           
			           //$("#myHeader").css("display","none");
			       	//}
			    //}
        
        4) 	
        	a) This function is used to position MOVE TO TOP section and decide when it will fadeIn or FadeOut .
			
		b) The "onscroll" event occurs when an element's scrollbar is being scrolled. When someone scroll it 
		calls  function.
	        	//$(window).scroll(function() {

	        The scrollTop property sets or returns the number of pixels an element's content is scrolled vertically.
		If it is greater then 600 then it will move inside the "if"  loop.	
		            //if ($(this).scrollTop() > 600 ) {

		    The jQuery stop() method is used to stop an animation or effect before it is finished.The stop()
		    method works for all jQuery effect functions, including sliding, fading and custom animations ,
		    whose syntax is "$(selector).stop(stopAll,goToEnd);" . This "$('.scrolltop:hidden')" will return
		    the element with class "scrolltop" when it is "hidden" . The fadeIn() method gradually changes 
		    the opacity, for selected elements, from hidden to visible (fading effect).       
		            	//$('.scrolltop:hidden').stop(true, true).fadeIn();

		    If it is not greater then 600 then it will move inside the "else"  loop.        
		            //} else {

		    The fadeOut() method gradually changes the opacity, for selected elements, from visible to 
		    hidden (fading effect).        
		            //$('.scrolltop').stop(true, true).fadeOut();
		            //}
		        //});

	    
	    5)	
	    	a) This function is used when we click on MOVE TO TOP button it takes the webpage to 0 px  .
			
		b) The click() method simulates a mouse-click on an element.This method can be used to execute a click on
		an element as if the user manually clicked on it , syntax HTMLElementObject.click() . It calls the
		function on click .	
		        //$(".scrolltop").click(function() {

		    The animate() method performs a custom animation of a set of CSS properties.This method changes an 
		    element from one state to another with CSS styles. The CSS property value is changed gradually, to 
		    create an animated effect, syntax (selector).animate({styles},speed,easing,callback) . It select
		    html's body on animate it to scroll top to 0 px in 1000 milliseconds.    
		            //$("html, body").animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, "1000");
		            //return false;
		        //});

        6)	
        	a) This function is used to animate the numbers present in the STAT section .
			
		b) The each() method specifies a function to run for each matched element. If there are number of 
		element with class name ".count-number" it will call function for each element .
	            //$('.count-number').each(function () {

	        The prop() method sets or returns properties and values of the selected elements.When this method is used
		to return the property value, it returns the value of the FIRST matched element , syntax 
		$(selector).prop(property,value) .It will initialise property "Counter" of element to "0" and animate it
		to "$(this).text()" in 4000 milliseconds .    
	               //$(this).prop('Counter',0).animate({
	               		//Counter: $(this).text()
	           		//}, {
		               //duration: 4000,

		    "easing" specifies the speed of the element in different points of the animation.            
		               //easing: 'swing',
		               //step: function (now) {

		    The ceil() method rounds a number UPWARDS to the nearest integer, and returns the result means we will
		    not get a decimal value , we will only get integer values .           
		                   //$(this).text(Math.ceil(now));
	               		//}
	           		//});
	         	//});


        7)

		whose id is "profile" and according to width of the document also it changes the css .
			
		b) The hover() method specifies two functions to run when the mouse pointer hovers over the selected
		elements , syntax $(selector).hover(inFunction,outFunction) . When cursor is hovered over element with
		id "developer" function is called . 
		        //$("#developer").hover(function(){

		    The css() method sets or returns one or more style properties for the selected elements.Element with
		    id "profile" is selected and in css of it sets "display" with "block" .    
		            //$("#profile").css("display", "block");

		    "width" is a variable through which we get the width of document .         
		            //var width = $(document).width();

		    If , "width" is less than or equal to 768 . Element with id "profile" is selected and in css
		    of it sets "width" , "margin-left" with "40%" and "50%" respectively.         
		            //if(width<=768){
		               //$("#profile").css("width","40%");
		               //$("#profile").css("margin-left","50%")
