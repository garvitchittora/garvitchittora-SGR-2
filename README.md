## FUNCTIONS OF JAVASCRIPT USED IN THE WEBPAGE:

#### There are 8 javascript functions used on the webpage :
````
Serial Number)
  a)Work

  b)Function Explaination	
````
		1)	
			a)

			b) The addEventListener() method attaches an event handler to an element without overwriting existing event handlers.
			syntax element.addEventListener(event, function) . I had used load event in addEventListener() which call the function when the webpage is completely loaded . 
			
				//window.addEventListener("load",function(){

			"loader" is a constant which has all elements of class name "overlay" .	

	    			//const loader=document.querySelector(".overlay");
	    	
	    	HTMLElementObject.className += class adds the "class" to the class name of the HTMLElementObject . we know loader has element with class name "overlay" . After the below given line is executed class name of loader is changed to "overlay hidden" . "hidden" class hides the loader after the webpage is loaded .
	    	
	    			//loader.className+=" hidden";
				//});


       	2)
       		a)
			
			b)

		        $(function() {
		            $('input[name="datefilter"]').daterangepicker({
		            autoUpdateInput: false,
		            locale: {
		               cancelLabel: 'Clear'
		            }
		            });
		            $('input[name="datefilter"]').on('apply.daterangepicker', function(ev, picker) {
		               $(this).val("    "+picker.startDate.format('MM/DD/YYYY') + ' - ' + picker.endDate.format('MM/DD/YYYY'));
		            });
		            $('input[name="datefilter"]').on('cancel.daterangepicker', function(ev, picker) {
		               $(this).val('       Add Dates Here By Clicking On It');
		            });
		        });
         

        3) 	
        	a)
			
			b) The "onscroll" event occurs when an element's scrollbar is being scrolled. When someone scroll it calls "myFunction" function.
		    	
		    	//window.onscroll = function() {myFunction()};

		    The getElementById() method returns the element that has the ID attribute with the specified value ,whose syntax is document.getElementById(elementID). "header" is a variable which has the element whose id is "myHeader" .
		    	
		    	//var header = document.getElementById("myHeader");

		    "myFunction" is a function which is being called by onscroll event as mentioned above.	

		    	//function myFunction() {
			
		    "pageYOffset" properties returns the pixels the current document has been scrolled from the upper left corner of the window, vertically , whose syntax is window.pageYOffset . If "pageYOffset" is greater then 600 the it will move inside the "if  loop" .	
			    	//if (window.pageYOffset > 600) {

			The classList property returns the class name(s) of an element, as a DOMTokenList object.This property is useful to add, remove and toggle CSS classes on an element. It will add "sticky" class to the class list of header .   	
			           //header.classList.add("sticky");

			The css() method sets or returns one or more style properties for the selected elements.Element with id "myHeader" is selected and in css of it sets "display" with "block" .           
			           //$("#myHeader").css("display","block");

			If "pageYOffset" is not greater then 600 the it will move inside the "else  loop" .           
			        //}else {

			It will remove "sticky" class to the class list of header .        
			           //header.classList.remove("sticky");

			Element with id "myHeader" is selected and in css of it sets "display" with "none" .           
			           //$("#myHeader").css("display","none");
			       	//}
			    //}
        
        4) 	
        	a)
			
			b) The "onscroll" event occurs when an element's scrollbar is being scrolled. When someone scroll it calls  function.
	        	//$(window).scroll(function() {

	        The scrollTop property sets or returns the number of pixels an element's content is scrolled vertically.If it is greater then 600 then it will move inside the "if"  loop.	
		            //if ($(this).scrollTop() > 600 ) {

		    The jQuery stop() method is used to stop an animation or effect before it is finished.The stop() method works for all jQuery effect functions, including sliding, fading and custom animations , whose syntax is "$(selector).stop(stopAll,goToEnd);" . This "$('.scrolltop:hidden')" will return the element with class "scrolltop" when it is "hidden" . The fadeIn() method gradually changes the opacity, for selected elements, from hidden to visible (fading effect).       
		            	//$('.scrolltop:hidden').stop(true, true).fadeIn();

		    If it is not greater then 600 then it will move inside the "else"  loop.        
		            //} else {

		    The fadeOut() method gradually changes the opacity, for selected elements, from visible to hidden (fading effect).        
		            //$('.scrolltop').stop(true, true).fadeOut();
		            //}
		        //});

	    
	    5)	
	    	a)
			
			b) The click() method simulates a mouse-click on an element.This method can be used to execute a click on an element as if the user manually clicked on it , syntax HTMLElementObject.click() . It calls the function on click .	
		        //$(".scrolltop").click(function() {

		    The animate() method performs a custom animation of a set of CSS properties.This method changes an element from one state to another with CSS styles. The CSS property value is changed gradually, to create an animated effect, syntax (selector).animate({styles},speed,easing,callback) . It select html's body on animate it to scroll top to 0 px in 1000 milliseconds.    
		            //$("html, body").animate({ scrollTop: 0 }, "1000");
		            //return false;
		        //});

        6)	
        	a)
			
			b) The each() method specifies a function to run for each matched element. If there are number of element with class name ".count-number" it will call function for each element .
	            //$('.count-number').each(function () {

	        The prop() method sets or returns properties and values of the selected elements.When this method is used to return the property value, it returns the value of the FIRST matched element , syntax $(selector).prop(property,value) .It will initialise property "Counter" of element to "0" and animate it to "$(this).text()" in 4000 milliseconds .    
	               //$(this).prop('Counter',0).animate({
	               		//Counter: $(this).text()
	           		//}, {
		               //duration: 4000,

		    "easing" specifies the speed of the element in different points of the animation.            
		               //easing: 'swing',
		               //step: function (now) {

		    The ceil() method rounds a number UPWARDS to the nearest integer, and returns the result means we will not get a decimal value , we will only get integer values .           
		                   //$(this).text(Math.ceil(now));
	               		//}
	           		//});
	         	//});


        7)
         	a)
			
			b) The hover() method specifies two functions to run when the mouse pointer hovers over the selected elements , syntax $(selector).hover(inFunction,outFunction) . When cursor is hovered over element with id "developer" function is called . 
		        //$("#developer").hover(function(){

		    The css() method sets or returns one or more style properties for the selected elements.Element with id "profile" is selected and in css of it sets "display" with "block" .    
		            //$("#profile").css("display", "block");

		    "width" is a variable through which we get the width of document .         
		            //var width = $(document).width();

		    If , "width" is less than or equal to 768 . Element with id "profile" is selected and in css of it sets "width" , "margin-left" with "40%" and "50%" respectively.         
		            //if(width<=768){
		               //$("#profile").css("width","40%");
		               //$("#profile").css("margin-left","50%")
		            //}  

		    Else , Element with id "profile" is selected and in css of it sets "width" , "margin-left" with "20%" and "75%" respectively.         
		            //else{
		               //$("#profile").css("width","20%");
		               //$("#profile").css("margin-left","75%")
		            //} 

		    If , Element is not hover then below given function is called and css property "display" of element with id "profile" is changed to "none" .       
		           //}, function(){
		           //$("#profile").css("display", "none");
		        //});


        8)
         	a)
			
			b)The hover() method specifies two functions to run when the mouse pointer hovers over the selected elements , syntax $(selector).hover(inFunction,outFunction) . When cursor is hovered over element with class "meet_doctor" function is called , that changes some of its css properties and its text with backgound color of its parent div .  	
		        //$(".meet_doctor").hover(function(){
		            //$(this).text("AVAILABLE!");
		            //$(this).css("margin-left","22%");
		            //$(this).css("font-size","17px");
		            //$("#meet-doctor-div").css("background-color","green");

		    If , Element is not hover then below given function is called , that changes some of its css properties and its text with backgound color of its parent div .
		         //}, function(){
		            //$(this).text("MEET THE DOCTOR");
